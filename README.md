This tutorial helps you gain confidence that Angular can do whatever you need it to do by showing you how to:

- Use Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.
- Create Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.
- Use one-way data binding for read-only data.
- Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
- Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
- Enable users to select a hero from a list and edit that hero in the details view.
- Format data with pipes.
- Create a shared service to assemble the heroes.
- Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
